# lexa: Manage documentary and descriptive linguistic data # lexa <a href="https://stefanocoretta.github.io/lexa/"><img src="man/figures/logo.png" align="right" height="120" /></a>

The goal of lexa is to provide a framework and tools to manage linguistic fieldwork data.

The package is still in its infancy and only a very limited set of features are being developed for the time being.
The package contains highly unstable code, so expect breaking changes at any point (although I will try to keep these at a minimum).

The current available features are:

- Create a Lexa database.
- Add lexical entries to the database.
- Search lexical entries by word or definition.
- Import lexical entries from a `.csv` file.

## Installation

You can install the latest version of lexa like so:

``` r
remotes::install_github(
  "stefanocoretta/lexa@v0.0.2",
  build_vignettes = TRUE
)
```

## Quick start

To create a new database:

``` r
library(lexa)

create_lexadb(
  parent = "./",
  name = "new_"
)
```

This will create a directory `new_lexadb/` in the parent directory (`./`).
See `vignette("database-schema", package = "lexa")` for details.

The `lexicon/` folder is populated with a file with an entry skeleton you can manually edit.

To create new entries you first need to load the database:

``` r
new_db <- load_lexadb("./new_lexadb")

new_db
```

Now you can add a new entry with:

``` r
add_entry(new_db)
```

This will create a new file with the entry skeleton, which you can edit.
The new `id` is automatically created for you based on the existing files.

To search your lexicon:

``` r
db_path <- system.file("extdata/eleryon_lexadb", package = "lexa")
eleryon <- load_lexadb(db_path)
eleryon

search_lexicon(eleryon, entry = "unullose")
search_lexicon(eleryon, definition = "tomorrow")
```
